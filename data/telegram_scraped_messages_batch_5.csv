This advisory provides network defenders with indicators of compromise (IOCs), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and detection methods associated with Ghost ransomware activity identified through FBI investigations.
Ghost actors conduct these widespread attacks targeting and compromising organizations with outdated versions of software and firmware on their internet facing services. These malicious ransomware actors are known to use publicly available code to exploit Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) where available patches have not been applied to gain access to internet facing servers. The known CVEs are CVE-2018-13379 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379), CVE-2010-2861 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-2861), CVE-2009-3960 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-3960), CVE-2021-34473 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34473), CVE-2021-34523 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34523), CVE-2021-31207 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31207).

CISA has added two vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), based on evidence of active exploitation.

CVE-2025-0108 (https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0108) Palo Alto PAN-OS Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
CVE-2024-53704 (https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-53704) SonicWall SonicOS SSLVPN Improper Authentication Vulnerability

These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01) established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet (https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf) for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) as part of their vulnerability management practice.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/02/12/cisa-and-fbi-warn-malicious-cyber-actors-using-buffer-overflow-vulnerabilities-compromise-software

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a Secure by Design Alert, Eliminating Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-eliminating-buffer-overflow-vulnerabilities), as part of their cooperative Secure by Design Alert series (https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/alerts)—an ongoing series aimed at advancing industry-wide best practices to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities during the design and development phases of the product lifecycle. “Eliminating Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities” describes proven techniques to prevent or mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities through secure by design principles and best practices.
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are a prevalent type of defect in memory-safe software design that can lead to system compromise. These vulnerabilities can lead to data corruption, sensitive data exposure, program crashes, and unauthorized code execution. Threat actors frequently exploit these vulnerabilities to gain initial access to an organization’s network and then move laterally to the wider network.
CISA and FBI urge manufacturers review the Alert and, where feasible, eliminate this class of defect by developing new software using memory-safe languages, using secure by design (https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign) methods, and implementing the best practices supplied in this Alert. CISA and FBI also urge software customers demand secure products (https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-demand-guide) from manufacturers that include these preventions. Visit CISA’s Secure by Design Pledge (https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge) page to learn about our voluntary pledge, which focuses on enterprise software products and services—including on-premises software, cloud services, and software as a service (SaaS).","{'neg': 0.118, 'neu': 0.709, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.9719}",0.9719,Israel Cyber Alerts,,"https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov",,
