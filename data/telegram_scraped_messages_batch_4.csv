https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/02/21/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), based on evidence of active exploitation.

CVE-2025-24989 (https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24989) Microsoft Power Pages Improper Access Control Vulnerability

These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01) established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet (https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf) for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities).","{'neg': 0.171, 'neu': 0.695, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': -0.4588}",-0.4588,Israel Cyber Alerts,,"https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cve.org,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov",,
