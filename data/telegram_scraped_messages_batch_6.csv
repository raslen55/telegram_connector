The common tools like Splunk, Tenable, etc. got ai-powered or ai-driven solutions. But I bet thats not what you would expect from AI.
They can identify anomalies across multiple systems on a huge data base or automatically generate reports for audits quite well. But they cannot detect and respond or fix threats in a way that it could replace an expert or fully automate parts of the incident handling process. They can actually support you and accelerate your work and give you quite good hints where to keep an eye on. 

Tools like appdynamics, datadog, splunk or new relic are often related to AIOps and suggest to you that this is the solution you are looking for. But instead you should have a look at the complete SDLC and focus on the origin of the risks. Build a DevSecOps pipeline which covers the development and the operation of the code/software which you operate or try to protect. Don’t let security be an afterthought. 

- Copilot can support you in checking your code 
- Veracode helps you identify and fix your code (SAST, DAST, SCA)
- Snyk covers the SAST part 
- tenable takes the vulnerability management part 
- and the tools mentioned at the beginning are usually monitoring tools at the end of the Pipeline / Lifecycle.

-1001574796698,2025-02-04 14:44:29,"📢 **התקפת DDoS עם ChatGPT**

נראה כי הסורק של ChatGPT מאפשר שליחת בקשות מרובות למיקוד דרך נקודת הקצה
/backend-api/attributions, עקב היעדר מניעת כפילויות והגבלת כתובות URL ב-API.
**
🛡 שיטת התקפה אפשרית:**
1️⃣ תוקף שולח בקשה אחת ל-API של ChatGPT עם רשימה ארוכה של כתובות URL כפולות.
2️⃣ הסורק של ChatGPT יוזם אוטומטית בקשות מקבילות לכל הכתובות האלו.
3️⃣ נוצרת הגברת התקפה (amplification effect) – בקשת התקפה אחת מובילה לעשרות ואף מאות בקשות סורק.
4️⃣ הבקשות נשלחות מכתובות IP לגיטימיות של Microsoft Azure, מה שמקשה על זיהוי וחסימה.

⚠️** למה זה מסוכן?**

אפשר לנצל זאת לביצוע התקפות DDoS עקיפות נגד שרתים ויעדים שונים.
הבקשות נראות ""אמינות"" כי הן מגיעות מתשתית של Microsoft.
קשה לזהות את מקור ההתקפה האמיתי.

**דרישות מקדימות**:
מחשב שיכול להריץ את Kali Linux.
ידע בסיסי על אופן הפעולה של יישומי רשת.

**מטרות למידה**:
להבין כיצד APIs פועלים.
ללמוד כיצד למפות נקודות קצה (endpoints) של API.
להבין פגיעויות נפוצות ביישומים מונעי API.
לבצע התקפות מוצלחות על נקודות קצה של API פגיעות.

-1001574796698,2023-10-02 06:12:22,"💻Exploit Chain 2023💻

An Exploit Chain is an attack that involves multiple exploits or attacks that are chained together to fully compromise a device. In these attacks, Hackers cannot use a single exploit to compromise their target but instead can combine a series of exploits that ultimately lead to malware getting installed on a smartphone (iOS or Android) which can lead to the loss of critical and sensitive data.  In the cases described in the video below, the websites visited by unsuspecting users contain a variety of attacks which when chained together can compromise the smart phones targeted.

✔️HOW DO I PROTECT MYSELF?

There are a few strategies you can employ to protect yourself from these chained exploits including:

💡Patch your iOS/Android device to the latest version of vendor OS for the best chance of protection based upon Apple and Android fixing these things without publicly disclosing them to the public.

💡Reboot your phone.  These exploit chains in their current incarnation was only valid while the device was live after visiting the malicious website.  Rebooting the device reverted to a pristine OS.
