This advisory provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and detection methods associated with known Medusa ransomware activity.
Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service variant used to conduct ransomware attacks; as of December 2024, over 300 victims from critical infrastructure sectors have been impacted. Medusa actors use common techniques like phishing campaigns and exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities.
Immediate actions organizations can take to mitigate Medusa ransomware activity: 

Ensure operating systems, software, and firmware are patched and up to date.
Segment networks to restrict lateral movement.
Filter network traffic by preventing unknown or untrusted origins from accessing remote services.

CISA encourages network defenders to review the advisory and implement the recommended mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of Medusa ransomware incidents. See #StopRansomware (https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware) and the #StopRansomware Guide (https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide) for additional guidance on ransomware protection, detection, and response.","{'neg': 0.263, 'neu': 0.675, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.9939}",-0.9939,Israel Cyber Alerts,,"https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov,https://www.cisa.gov",,

Today, CISA—in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)—released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory, #StopRansomware: Ghost (Cring) Ransomware (https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-050a). This advisory provides network defenders with indicators of compromise (IOCs), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and detection methods associated with Ghost ransomware activity identified through FBI investigations.
Ghost actors conduct these widespread attacks targeting and compromising organizations with outdated versions of software and firmware on their internet facing services. These malicious ransomware actors are known to use publicly available code to exploit Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) where available patches have not been applied to gain access to internet facing servers. The known CVEs are CVE-2018-13379 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379), CVE-2010-2861 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-2861), CVE-2009-3960 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-3960), CVE-2021-34473 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34473), CVE-2021-34523 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34523), CVE-2021-31207 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31207).
CISA encourages network defenders to review this advisory and apply the recommended mitigations.

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a Secure by Design Alert, Eliminating Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-eliminating-buffer-overflow-vulnerabilities), as part of their cooperative Secure by Design Alert series (https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/alerts)—an ongoing series aimed at advancing industry-wide best practices to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities during the design and development phases of the product lifecycle. “Eliminating Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities” describes proven techniques to prevent or mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities through secure by design principles and best practices.
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are a prevalent type of defect in memory-safe software design that can lead to system compromise. These vulnerabilities can lead to data corruption, sensitive data exposure, program crashes, and unauthorized code execution. Threat actors frequently exploit these vulnerabilities to gain initial access to an organization’s network and then move laterally to the wider network.
CISA and FBI urge manufacturers review the Alert and, where feasible, eliminate this class of defect by developing new software using memory-safe languages, using secure by design (https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign) methods, and implementing the best practices supplied in this Alert. CISA and FBI also urge software customers demand secure products (https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-demand-guide) from manufacturers that include these preventions.

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01) established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats.

The common tools like Splunk, Tenable, etc. got ai-powered or ai-driven solutions. But I bet thats not what you would expect from AI.
They can identify anomalies across multiple systems on a huge data base or automatically generate reports for audits quite well. But they cannot detect and respond or fix threats in a way that it could replace an expert or fully automate parts of the incident handling process. They can actually support you and accelerate your work and give you quite good hints where to keep an eye on. 

Tools like appdynamics, datadog, splunk or new relic are often related to AIOps and suggest to you that this is the solution you are looking for. But instead you should have a look at the complete SDLC and focus on the origin of the risks. Build a DevSecOps pipeline which covers the development and the operation of the code/software which you operate or try to protect. Don’t let security be an afterthought. 

- Copilot can support you in checking your code 
- Veracode helps you identify and fix your code (SAST, DAST, SCA)
- Snyk covers the SAST part 
- tenable takes the vulnerability management part 
- and the tools mentioned at the beginning are usually monitoring tools at the end of the Pipeline / Lifecycle.

Try to cover all aspects and focus on a shift-left security strategy to reduce the noise at the end.","{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.17, 'compound': 0.989}",0.989,IT Security Talk,,,,

-1001574796698,2025-02-04 14:44:29,"📢 **התקפת DDoS עם ChatGPT**

נראה כי הסורק של ChatGPT מאפשר שליחת בקשות מרובות למיקוד דרך נקודת הקצה
/backend-api/attributions, עקב היעדר מניעת כפילויות והגבלת כתובות URL ב-API.
**
🛡 שיטת התקפה אפשרית:**
1️⃣ תוקף שולח בקשה אחת ל-API של ChatGPT עם רשימה ארוכה של כתובות URL כפולות.
2️⃣ הסורק של ChatGPT יוזם אוטומטית בקשות מקבילות לכל הכתובות האלו.
3️⃣ נוצרת הגברת התקפה (amplification effect) – בקשת התקפה אחת מובילה לעשרות ואף מאות בקשות סורק.
4️⃣ הבקשות נשלחות מכתובות IP לגיטימיות של Microsoft Azure, מה שמקשה על זיהוי וחסימה.

⚠️** למה זה מסוכן?**

אפשר לנצל זאת לביצוע התקפות DDoS עקיפות נגד שרתים ויעדים שונים.
הבקשות נראות ""אמינות"" כי הן מגיעות מתשתית של Microsoft.
קשה לזהות את מקור ההתקפה האמיתי.

-1001574796698,2023-10-02 06:12:22,"💻Exploit Chain 2023💻

An Exploit Chain is an attack that involves multiple exploits or attacks that are chained together to fully compromise a device. In these attacks, Hackers cannot use a single exploit to compromise their target but instead can combine a series of exploits that ultimately lead to malware getting installed on a smartphone (iOS or Android) which can lead to the loss of critical and sensitive data.  In the cases described in the video below, the websites visited by unsuspecting users contain a variety of attacks which when chained together can compromise the smart phones targeted.

✔️HOW DO I PROTECT MYSELF?

There are a few strategies you can employ to protect yourself from these chained exploits including:

💡Patch your iOS/Android device to the latest version of vendor OS for the best chance of protection based upon Apple and Android fixing these things without publicly disclosing them to the public.

💡Reboot your phone.  These exploit chains in their current incarnation was only valid while the device was live after visiting the malicious website.  Rebooting the device reverted to a pristine OS.

-1001574796698,2023-08-12 19:56:27,"GhostManSec, or GMS Sploit, is a powerful tool with 8 diverse functions.

Firstly, it has the ability to create a Backdoor, allowing users to remotely access a system with ease. Next, GMS Sploit can perform layer7 DDoS attacks, overloading the target server by attacking web applications.

Additionally, this tool also supports layer4 DDoS attacks, causing network overload and disrupting services on the server. GMS Sploit can also check if the target is vulnerable to SQLi (SQL Injection), a common security loophole in web applications. It can also check for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, another loophole that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a website.

The tool provides a feature to test the admin login page (Page Login Admin), helping users detect security vulnerabilities in the login system. GMS Sploit also supports checking the ports of a server, helping to determine open and closed ports on the system.

Lastly, this tool allows for the exploitation of SQLi security vulnerabilities and gathering information from the database. This helps users identify security loopholes and gather important information from the target system.

As a result, we issue this warning: we have already targeted 2000 Bengali and Indonesian websites. We demand that you address our grievances and meet our demands. 

Arrest the individuals engaged in these black hat activities within your borders, or we will escalate our actions. This is a serious warning, as your citizens have breached Western cyberspace. 

While we initially intended to let our Indian allies handle this matter, your actions have forced us to reconsider. 

Failure to apprehend these individuals will lead us to view your countries as supporters of terrorism. We will engage in cyber warfare against your nations, treating you as we do towards terrorists. 

We will provide you with one of the perpetrator's IP addresses for arrest. Use this individual as a whistleblower to identify and apprehend others involved. If the perpetrator alerts their associates or attempts to delete evidence, ensure they spend the rest of their lives behind bars.

Next we may post Indonesia and then we might post Bangladesh again if our ultimatum isn't met, if all of a sudden every black hat removes statements such as ""OPArgentina"" ""OPUSA"" ""OPCIA"" out of their posts and stops trying to target the western cyberspace we will cease this work.
